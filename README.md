##RootExtractor

###Pascal. Trying out a few different algorithms for finding the roots of numbers.


Algorithms are referenced in their folders, but most were found here: [Wikipedia - Methods of computing square roots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots)
or in old textbooks.
